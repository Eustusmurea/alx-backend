# 0x01. Caching

| `Back-end` |

## Background Context

In this project, you learn different caching algorithms.

## Resources

**Read and watch**

+ [Cache replacement policies - LIFO](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/U44RQjXp8xBtsbNIyhHIyw)
+ [Cache replacement policies - LRU](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/gKerxvR4dnXQYkBX2ujZiQ)
+ [Cache replacement policies - MRU](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Tmk4qEBZ7QTknvbpKabWfQ)
+ [Cache replacement policies - LFU](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/8PEJ8L34bxhL2y--BW5zGQ)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
+ What a caching system is
+ What FIFO means
+ What LIFO means
+ What LRU means
+ What MRU means
+ What LFU means
+ What the purpose of a caching system
+ What limits a caching system have

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

+ All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
+ A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
+ Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
+ All your files must be executable
+ The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
+ All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
+ All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
+ All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
+ A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
